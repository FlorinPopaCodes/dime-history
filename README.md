# Dime History ðŸª™

This extension deletes items in the browsers history that are older than 14
days. That's it!

## How does this work

After you install the plugin, it waits for the browser to become idle (after
around a minute) and then it starts deleting EVERYTHING older than 14 days.

## Icon

The icon is taken from [Official open source SVG icon library for Bootstrap.](https://github.com/twbs/icons)
