# Dime History ðŸª™

This extension deletes items in the browsers history that are older than 14
days. That's it!


## Motivation

I wanted to be more mindful with how I approach bookmarking and the things
that I allow to pop-up in my browser's address bar once I start typing, so 
I decided to create a simple extension that just deletes everything older
than two weeks.


## How does this work

After you install the extension, it waits for the browser to become idle
(after around a minute) and then it starts deleting EVERYTHING older than
14 days.
